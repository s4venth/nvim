# !! My Nvim config !!
My personal Neovim config

## Why?
I really liked the experience using LunarVim, but found the customization of it needlessly complicated.
As such, I decided to go with my own config with largely the same plugins, but with simpler customization
and less abstraction.

## Dependencies
The dependencies are:
  - `make` for building [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) and [telescope-fzf-native.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim)
  - [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) nightly/pre-release for winbar support
  - [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide) (Optional)

## Special thanks
  - [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)
